        <h3>YOUR RIGHTS AS OUR CUSTOMER</h3>
        <p>
          The City of Bacoor recognizes that you should be the ultimate
          decision-maker on matters that involve your Personal Information. To
          this end, we are mindful of the fundamental right to privacy of every
          customer under the Data Privacy Act of 2012.
        </p>
        <p>
          By accepting the Terms and Conditions for the use of LGU Online
          services, you agree to the collection, processing, use, and sharing of

        </p>
        <p>
          You have the right to be informed of the Personal Information that we
          collect, process, use, and share. We can provide you with such
          Personal Information, provided that such Personal Information does not
          amount to information deemed confidential or proprietary by the LGU,
          or that your request for Personal Information is not vexatious or
          unreasonable.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have the right to object or withhold your consent to the
          collection, processing, use, and sharing of your Personal Information.
          However, we may be constrained to terminate your desired service as
          your Personal Information may be required to deliver such product or
          service. Without your Personal Information, we will be unable to
          provide you with updates on the LGU’s latest offerings; similarly, you
          will be unable to participate in our related events, promotions, or
          other activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have the right to suspend, withdraw, or order the blocking,
          removal, or destruction of your Personal Information in our processing
          systems upon discovery and substantial proof that your Personal
          Information is no longer necessary for the purpose or purposes for
          which it was collected, and for such other cases provided in the Data
          Privacy Act of 2012.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have the right to seek indemnity for damages sustained, if any,

          or unauthorized use of your Personal Information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should you feel that there has been mishandling or misuse of your
          Personal Information, or that any of your data privacy rights have
          been violated, you may email us at mis@bacoor.gov.ph
        </p>

          directly and certainly identify an individual, such as name, gender,
          date of birth, address, telephone/mobile number, email address, proof
          of identification, etc. It also includes information about:
        </p>
        <p>The services provided to you, as follows</p>

          <li>Real Property Tax Assessment</li>
          <li>Online Payment</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Non-Personal</strong> Information is any information that does
          not identify you individually, and includes statistical or analytical
          data, and anonymized or aggregated reports.
        </p>
        <h3>USE OF CUSTOMER DATA</h3>
        <p>
          We may share Customer Data with our subsidiaries, affiliates,
          partners, and third-party service providers as part of business
          operations and provision of products and services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Customer Data is
          used to, among others:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            Process information for statistical, analytical, and research
            purposes. The use of your information for statistical, analytical,
            and research purposes enables us to create anonymized and aggregated
            insight reports that we use to further improve your user experience
            and to provide new products and services;
          </li>
          <li>
            Create a customer portrait based on your demographic, and your
            behavioral, transaction, and interaction data across all products,
            systems, devices, and/or interaction channels, which we may use as a
            basis for sending you commercial and promotional alerts,
            personalized advertisements, financial service offers, and surveys.
            To be clear, should we need to share data with third parties for
            advertising and marketing purposes, we only share anonymized and
            aggregated data, and not your Personal Information;
          </li>

            court order; to comply with a legal obligation; or to prevent
            imminent harm to public security, safety, or order, collectively
            referred to as “Data Use Purpose.”
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When required by our Privacy Policy and the law, and before we
          collect, process, use, or share your Personal Information for any
          other purpose other than enumerated above, we will ask for your
          consent.
